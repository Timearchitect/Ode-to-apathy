Hey, just wanted to know if you can make it to the protest later.

Anyways, call me later ok?

Hey, it’s Sarah
I just picked up Mark’s phone and belongings from the police station.
It’s really bad Viktor, 
they won’t release him after the protest and he’s beat up real bad. 
I don’t know what to do. 
Please pick up Viktor…
